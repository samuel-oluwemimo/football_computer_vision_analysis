## Overview
This project aims to analyze football matches using advanced computer vision techniques. The analysis includes player tracking, ball tracking, speed and distance calculations, and more. The following methods are employed:

### Features
- **Color Segmentation**: Utilizing KMeans for uniform detection.
- **Player Tracking**: Enhanced model fine-tuning for accurate detection of players, referees, and the ball.
- **Ball Interpolation**: Precise tracking and interpolation of ball movement.
- **Speed and Distance Calculation**: Accurate measurement of player and ball dynamics.
- **Motion Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of player movements.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Implemented using YOLO for accurate spatial analysis.

### Tools and Technologies
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: For real-time object detection.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and data analysis.
- **Supervision**: For overseeing the entire analysis process.
